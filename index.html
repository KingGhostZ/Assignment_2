        <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>My name is Christopher Kingsley. I attend North Carolina Agricultural & Technical University for Computer Engineering. <br>
    I am currently about to be completing my fourth year with most of my last few required classes for me degree. It has been a <br>
    wonderful experience here at my school and has made me more experienced in my field. <br> <br> Over the last couple years, I have 
    worked with several different languages such as C++, C, Java, Python, VHDL, and SQL. <br>Working to enhance both my strengths and my weaknesses. However, it was all to answer my one big question in my life. Which was how do <br>computers work? This question is my reasoning for going down this path of learning about technology and working in both the IT field, computer science <br>field, and the computer engineering field. During my down time, I enjoy working on my own projects or taking more classes to <br>answer these questions and broaden my own capabilities. <br> However, with my senior year coming up, I will be working on more team based projects and will have bigger responsibilites. </p>
